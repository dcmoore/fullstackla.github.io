<p>If you're a seasoned open source committer/maintainer, we love you, come show
us how it's done (we are a truly captive audience). If you have never pushed
code to an open source project, you have come to the right place. We are here
to help you find projects, identify issues, and understand the process of pull
down, building, and pushing up new code.</p>
