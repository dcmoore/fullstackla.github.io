## Featured Project

This week Fullstack LA welcomes Johan Gyllenspetz to give a talk about his company's open source project, [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/){:target="_blank"}.ðŸ˜±

Say "hi" to Johan on [Github](https://github.com/gyllen){:target="_blank"} or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gyllen){:target="_blank"} and check out his [Mapillary page](https://www.mapillary.com/app/user/gyllen){:target="_blank"} while you're at it.

From the [Mapillary Website](https://www.mapillary.com/press){:target="_blank"}:

>*Mapillary is a service for crowdsourcing map photos. Using simple tools like smartphones or action cameras anyone can collect photos that are combined into a collective street level photo view.*

>*Mapillary provides apps for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, together with tools for using action cameras like GoPro and Garmin Virb.*

>*Mapillary also provides a set of APIs so that others can build solutions using the photos and the data extracted. There is also a viewer and widget that anyone can embed.*

After learning about Mapillary we'll dive into the code with Johan. We look forward to seeing you there! ðŸ˜„
