Join us to dive into open source projects. Get ready to roll up your sleeves
and get to the code. Everyone is encouraged to improve open source projects and
submit a pull requests.

If you're a seasoned open source committer/maintainer, we love you, come show
us how it's done (we are a truly captive audience). If you have never pushed
code to an open source project, you have come to the right place. We are here
to help you find projects, identify issues, and understand the process of pull
down, building, and pushing up new code.

All the coding is done in pairs, so you're never without someone to code with.
Pair programing with new people is a great way to make new friends. Friends are
welcome, but be ready to pair with new ones.

While everyone is welcome, it is recommended that you have done some coding in
the past. With coding, the first few steps can be the hardest. We are happy to
assist everyone at all levels. The focus of this group is on open source
contributions and getting folks past the first, tenth and hundredth pull
request.
