Join us for Open Source Pair Programming! Get ready to roll up your sleeves and get to the code! 

Everyone is encouraged to improve open source projects and submit a pull requests. If you're a seasoned open source committer/maintainer, we love you, come show us how it's done (we are a truly captive audience)!

Open-Source Projects we <3 include:

- [Exercism](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io){:target="_blank"} 
- [Hoodie](https://github.com/hoodiehq/){:target="_blank"}
- [Homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew){:target="_blank"}

While everyone is welcome, it is recommended that you have done some coding in the past. With coding, the first few steps can be the hardest. We are happy to assist everyone at all levels.
